- Software: Jupyter Notebook 6.0.1, VS Code

## Challenge Overview
In this challenge, you will be finding a few key aspects of Oahu’s seasonal weather data. The investors want to ensure you’ve hit all of the key points before opening the surf shop.

## Challenge Summary

[june.csv](june.csv)  
[december.csv](december.csv)

Based on the statistics shown in the csv files above, June appears to have nicer weather for business. June's mean temperature is higher by almost 4°.  In addition the mean precipitation is lower in June.

June's standard deviation is lower than December's in regards to both the precipitation and temperature which means the weather is more stable in June.

The minimum temperature is higher in June than in December. (June 64°, December 56°)  
The maximum temperature is higher in June than in December. (June 85°, December 83°)  

Recommendations for further analysis:  
1.  It would be interesting to see a map of where the measurement stations are located. It's possible that some are nearby good business locations and others are not.
2.  Some data is missing from the prcp column in the database. It would be interesting to extract information on the dates that data is missing to draw a conclusion on why it was not recorded.
3.  Further analysis based on daily, weekly, or yearly time frames is possible. Perhaps to recommend the best weeks of the year to sell ice cream.
